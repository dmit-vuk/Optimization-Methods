# Optimization-Methods
Optimization Methods in ML course in CMC MSU

- __labs__ (There are laboratory (practicum) works):
  * __task1__: Implementation of different optimization methods (HeavyBall, FastNesterov, Newton, BFGS) for classification tasks
  * __task2__: Implementation of different optimization methods (FrankWolfe, ProximalMethod) with limitations for classification task and extragradient-mirror method for matrix game.
  * __task3__: Implementation of different stochastic optimization methods (SGD, SAGA). Implementation of different adaptive optimization methods (AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam).

- __theory__ (There are theory works):
  *__task1__: Matrix-vector differentiation. Ð¡onvexity
  *__task2__: Concordance, duality, CCT. Subgradient and subdifferential
